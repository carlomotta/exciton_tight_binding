# exciton_tight_binding
This code is used to simulate an exciton (electron-hole pair) on a 3D lattice in presence of disorder

Copyright (C) 2015, Carlo Motta <mottac@tcd.ie>

This code represents a self-consistent tight-binding model 
for an exciton in a cubic 3-dimensional lattice with disorder. 
The main quantities that can be extracted by this code are the
exciton binding energy and its spatial localization. For more 
information about the theory and the algorithm, please consult:
